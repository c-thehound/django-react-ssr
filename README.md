# django-react-ssr
An example of how to setup Django and server side rendered React.js

## Dynamic server side rendering
An express.js server that takes in the stats file generated by webpack-bundle-tracker, and responds with the rendered html.

## Static server side rendering
A custom webpack plugin is made that takes in a list of bundles to statically render to html and save.
The rendered html is saved to a .html file and the location is recorded into a .json file with the bundle id as key.

## Django
Basic Django + django-webpack-loader. The latter is used for easy inclusion of bundles in templates.
A custom template tag is made to load the statically rendered html and include that in the template.
